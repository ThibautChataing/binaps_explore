 This is supplementary material for the paper "Differentiable Pattern Set Mining".
 
 
 Data constructed specifically by the authors is given in the Data/ directory, more information on this data, and where to find the other -- publicly available -- data sets used in the paper, is given in Data/README.
 
 A python implementation of BinaPs based on PyTorch is available in the Binaps_code/ directory, along with a README on package dependencies and examples.
 
 For all other methods, we used the publicly available implementations and set hyperparameters according to their suggestions:
